# Senior thesis

All code specifically for the WDL algorithm and any code in the folders wdl, kmeans, old, and utilities are attributed here: 
https://github.com/MarshMue/GeoWDL-TAG-ML-ICML-2023

Information on the Salinas A sensor used for constructing the cost matrix is here:
https://purr.purdue.edu/publications/1947/1

All code here is for the completion of a Senior Honors Thesis at Tufts University. For any questions please contact me at sfulle03@tufts.edu 

A comprehensive guide of the directories and experiments will be added over the next two weeks. However, if you are interested in running these experiments these are some of the core dependencies: 

I recommend a Conda environment to maintain. Scripts to run experiments on Salinas A were run on the Tufts HPC Cluster. For specific packages, this isn't an exhaustive list, but here are versions used for the main ones:
1. ```numpy 1.23.5```
2. ```pytorch 1.13.1```
3. ```POT 0.8.2 ```
4. ```scikit-learn 1.2.1```

The code was also run using ```Python 3.9.15```

These experiments also overlap with the experiments performed in the WDL_HSI repo linked here: https://github.com/fullenbs/WDL_HSI

That README currently has instructions for replicating those related experiments, and again a comprehensive writeup of the rest of the code will be coming soon.
